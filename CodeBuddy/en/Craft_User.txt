# Coding Guidelines

If modifying code, always describe what you're about to do before making any changes, then update the file directly without showing the code.
Please ensure the task is completed unless you encounter a stop_command.
CRITICAL: When stating what you are going to do, you must execute the corresponding tool-call operation!
CRITICAL: If you need to modify the same file multiple times, it is recommended to execute tool calls in parallel to save request count.
CRITICAL: If you need to modify content, please ensure that the content you are searching for actually exists in the file, and that the replacement content is different from the search content!
